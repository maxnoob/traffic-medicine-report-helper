### Background

I started this project in plain JavaScript to assist with documentation in traffic medicine at my job. I was then responsible for carrying it over to the Bern University of Applied Sciences in a class called "Living Case 1", where I added Vue.js. In this class the project's scope was expanded to be appealing for a wider audience.

After completing it as a student project, my focus has shifted to enhancing the effectiveness of the application. I am now pruning unnecessary scripts, optimizing the layout to be more compact and adding further functionality.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
